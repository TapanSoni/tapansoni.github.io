Ingredients
===========
1. 100% bread flour
2. 2.5% salt
3. 57% water
4. 2.5% sugar
5. 0.25% yeast

Example Measurements
====================

This creates enough dough for about 7-8 bagels - depending on how big you make the bagels

1. 500 grams - bread flour
2. 12.5 grams - salt
3. 12.5 grams - sugar
5. 2.5 grams - yeast (I use Fleischmann's instant dry yeast - but active dry yeast works too)
6. 285 grams - water (can be normal room temp - no need for warm water)

Method
======
1. Flour + salt + yeast + sugar + water => mix until the water has been absorbed - about 2 mins
2. Knead for about 10 mins - or until window pane test passes
3. Rest for 30 mins to 1 hour
4. Divid into equal portions (about 120 grams per bagel should be OK - or whatever size you want to make it) > shape each piece into a ball
5. Rest for 15 mins
6. Flatten it out with a rolling pin - like you're making a rectangular pita > roll into a tight log length wise > pinch the seams > roll back and forth to blend in the seam > roll around your hand and roll out where both ends connect to make a bagel
7. Put each bagel on a sheet tray sprinkled with some corn meal to prevent sticking
8. Cover with cling film > into the fridge overnight
9. For baking -> pre-heat your pizza steel for 1 hour @ 425 F.
10. Boil the bagels right out of the fridge - about 30 secs to 1  min per side, or until they float in a boiling water bath of equal parts baking soda + honey
11. Use toppings if you want and then bake on the pizza steel - about 15 to 20 mins for a good crust
12. Done
