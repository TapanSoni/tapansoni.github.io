Method
======
1. Flour + water + salt + yeast + sugar => mix
2. Knead for 10 mins
4. Rest for 30 mins to 1 hour
5. Divid into equal portions (about 120 grams per bagel should be OK - or whatever size you want to make it) > shape each piece into a ball
6. Rest for 15 mins
7. Flatten it out with a rolling pin - like you're making a rectangular pita > roll into a tight log length wise > pinch the seams > roll back and forth to blend in the seam > roll around your hand and roll out where both ends connect to make a bagel
8. Put each bagel on a sheet tray sprinkled with some corn meal to prevent sticking
9. Cover with cling film > into the fridge overnight
10. For baking -> pre-heat your pizza steel for 1 hour @ 425 F.
11. Boil the bagels right out of the fridge - about 30 secs to 1  min per side, or until they float in a boiling water bath of equal parts baking soda + honey
12. Use toppings if you want and then bake on the pizza steel - about 15 to 20 mins for a good crust
13. Done
