Ingredients
===========
1. 100% bread flour
2. 2.5% salt
3. 60% water
4. 2.5% sugar
5. 2.5% olive oil
6. 0.25% yeast

Method
======
1. Flour + salt + yeast + sugar + olive oil + water => mix
2. Knead for 10 mins
3. Rest for 30 mins
4. Divide into equal portions - I usually do 2 per recipe > cover with some oil > into the fridge overnight - 2 days is better if you have the time
5. Bring it out 3-4 hours before making the pizza to bring it up to room temp (very important)
6. Pizza time!
