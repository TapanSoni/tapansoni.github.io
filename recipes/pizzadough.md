# Pizza Dough

### Ingredients

1. 100% bread flour
2. 2.5% salt
3. 60% water
4. 2.5% sugar
5. 2.5% olive oil
6. 0.25% yeast

### Example Measurements

This creates enough dough for 2 decent size pizzas - depending on how you divide them

1. 500 grams - bread flour
2. 12.5 grams - salt
3. 12.5 grams - sugar
4. 12.5 grams - olive oil
5. 2.5 grams - yeast (I use Fleischmann's instant dry yeast - but active dry yeast works too)
6. 300 grams - water (can be normal room temp - no need for warm water)

### Method

1. Flour + salt + yeast + sugar + olive oil + water => mix until the water has been absorbed - about 2 mins
2. Knead for about 10 mins - or until window pane test passes
3. Rest for 30 mins
4. Divide into equal portions - I usually do 2 per recipe > cover with some oil > into the fridge overnight - 2 days is better if you have the time
5. Bring it out 3-4 hours before making the pizza to bring it up to room temp (very important)
6. Pizza time!
