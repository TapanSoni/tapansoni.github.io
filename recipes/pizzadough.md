Ingredients
===========
100% bread flour
2.5% salt
60% water
2.5% sugar
2.5% olive oil
0.25% yeast

Method
======
Flour + salt + yeast + sugar + water => mix
Knead for 10 mins
Rest for 30 mins
Divide into equal portions - I usually do 2 per recipe > cover with some oil > into the fridge overnight - 2 days is better if you have the time
Bring it out 3-4 hours before making the pizza to bring it up to room temp (very important)
Pizza time!
